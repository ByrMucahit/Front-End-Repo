            <h1>Inheritance cascades downwards</h1>
            <p>Properties that can be inherited cascade downwards, and child elements will get a computed value which
                represents its parentâ€™s value. This means that if a parent has <code>font-weight</code> set to
                <code>300</code>: all child elements will be light unless they have <code>font-weight</code> set to a
                different value or the user agent stylesheet has a value for <code>font-weight</code>,
                for that element. </p>
            <p>That is the case here. All text is <code>font-weight: 300</code>, but <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                elements have a <code>font-weight</code> of <code>700</code> which overrides the inheritance.
                <span>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, so the text is bold weight</span>.</p>
            <p>Notice also how the inline code <em>also</em> inherits the bold <code>font-weight</code>.</p>
